# advent of code 2018

## intro

My take on
<https://adventofcode.com/2018>

Trying to use functional JS.
Minimum side effects.
Tested and straightforward stuff.

## file patterns

    01-25.input.txt -> the input for each question
    01-25[ab].txt -> the questions themselves (in part a and b)
    01-25.js -> the solutions I found
    01-25.test.js -> tests to assert the solution codes

## how to install

    yarn

## how to use

all tests:

    yarn test

a single test:

    npx yarn 04.test.js
